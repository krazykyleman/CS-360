Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  -The app I developed is a weight tracking application intended to help users monitor and manage their weight. The core requirements of the app included user authentication, data storage and management, user interactions, and conditional SMS notifications. The app was designed to address users' need to easily and consistently track their daily weight, analyze their progress, and receive SMS goal notifications.

  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  -The necessary screens included a login/registration screen, a main dashboard for weight data display and a screen to add/update weight data, and a screen to set the weight goal. The user interface was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, keeping in mind simplicity and ease of navigation. Features such as simple forms for data input, a clear display of tracked weight information, and SMS notifications were implemented to offer users an engaging and seamless experience. The design was successful because it provided users with clear and accessible means to track their weight data.

  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  -I followed an iterative and modular approach to coding the app, starting with building a basic structure and then adding features one by one. This included creating user authentication functionality, building a SQLite database for data storage and management, developing the UI, and implementing the SMS notification system. Regular testing was conducted using Android Studio's Emulator. In the future, these strategies can be applied to ensure gradual development and thorough testing of features, which can lead to more robust and reliable applications.

  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  -I continuously tested the app during its development using Android Studio's Emulator. This included testing both positive and negative cases to ensure the app behaved as expected. For instance, testing the SMS notification feature with both granted and denied permissions. Testing is important as it reveals potential bugs, helps maintain code quality, and ensures the app functions as intended. It revealed areas where the app could fail and allowed for improvements.

  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  -One major challenge was handling the situation when a user denies the SMS permission. To overcome this, I had to design a way to keep the rest of the application functional without this feature, ensuring that the user experience remained smooth and uninterrupted.

  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  -I believe the development of the SQLite database and the related CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations were particularly successful demonstrations of my skills. This part of the app required a deep understanding of how data is managed in Android applications, and I was able to efficiently develop it to meet user needs. It was a complex task that required thoughtful design and careful implementation, and I was able to apply my knowledge and experience effectively to accomplish it.
